# arxiv.gg Marketing And Monetization Research

Status: research draft / maybe plan  
Date: 2026-05-16

## Short Version

Do not charge for access to arXiv papers. Keep public paper, author, category, search, and citation pages open for SEO and trust.

Charge for workflow: alerts, saved research memory, summaries, semantic monitoring, digests, team reading lists, exports, and API access.

The strongest product wedge is:

> arxiv.gg is a research radar for people who cannot keep up with arXiv.

## Current Asset

arxiv.gg already has:

- 644,298 indexed papers.
- 644,168 embeddings.
- 21.2% arXiv.org corpus coverage as of 2026-05-16.
- Searchable paper pages.
- Author and category pages.
- Semantic search.
- Citation graph features.
- Full sitemap shards and IndexNow.
- GitHub/project credibility.

That means the free product should stay open and crawlable. The paid product should sit on top of the graph and search index.

## Compliance Notes

Before monetizing, add or confirm:

- Clear footer: `Not affiliated with arXiv.org`.
- arXiv data acknowledgement: `Thank you to arXiv for use of its open access interoperability.`
- Link users to arxiv.org for PDFs/source unless a paper license clearly permits redistribution.
- Avoid branding that implies arXiv endorsement.

Relevant arXiv docs:

- https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/index.html
- https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/tou.html
- https://info.arxiv.org/help/license/index.html

## Target Users

Best early buyers:

- ML engineers tracking new papers.
- PhD students trying to keep up with a subfield.
- AI lab researchers watching specific authors, labs, and topics.
- Startup teams monitoring technical moats.
- Quant / physics / math people with narrow daily feeds.

Weak buyers:

- Casual search users.
- People who only land from Google for one paper.
- Students looking for a free PDF.

## Positioning

Possible headline:

> Keep up with arXiv without reading arXiv all day.

Supporting copy:

> Follow authors, topics, and semantic research questions. Get daily paper radar, citation alerts, and concise briefs when something actually matters.

Avoid positioning:

- "Better arXiv"
- "arXiv Pro"
- "Official arXiv"
- Anything that sounds affiliated or endorsed.

## Free Product

Keep these free:

- Search.
- Paper pages.
- Author pages.
- Category pages.
- Citation graph preview.
- Basic semantic search.
- Public API stats.
- 20 saved papers.
- 3 follows across authors/categories/topics.
- Weekly digest.

Reason: free pages build traffic, backlinks, search trust, and the top of funnel.

## Paid Product

### Pro: $12-15/month

For individual researchers and builders.

- Unlimited saved papers.
- Unlimited author/category/topic follows.
- Daily personalized paper radar.
- Semantic alerts, for example: "new papers like efficient long-context inference."
- Paper briefs:
  - TL;DR
  - contribution
  - methods
  - limitations
  - why it matters
  - related papers
- Citation alerts: "new paper cited this."
- Export bundles: BibTeX, RIS, CSV, Zotero-friendly.
- Private notes and reading queue.

### Power: $29/month

For heavy users.

- Everything in Pro.
- Literature briefs across a topic.
- Compare selected papers.
- Research gap finder.
- "What changed this week/month?" reports.
- More semantic alerts.
- API key with reasonable limits.

### Teams / Labs: $99-299/month

For small labs and companies.

- Shared reading lists.
- Shared annotations.
- Team digests.
- Slack/email alerts.
- Watchlists for authors, labs, competitors, keywords, and semantic topics.
- Admin billing.

### Enterprise: Custom

Only after pull from users.

- SSO.
- Higher API limits.
- Custom data sources.
- Private deployment.
- Procurement/security docs.

## Best First Paid Feature

Build semantic alerts first.

Example:

> Alert me when a new paper is about inference optimization for long-context LLMs, even if it does not mention those exact words.

Why this is the best wedge:

- It is clearly differentiated from raw arXiv search.
- It saves daily attention.
- It uses existing embeddings.
- It creates recurring usage.
- It naturally supports email capture.

## Feature Ideas

High priority:

- Account system.
- Saved papers.
- Follow author/category/topic.
- Semantic alert queries.
- Daily/weekly email digest.
- Simple Stripe subscription.
- "Why this matters" paper brief.

Medium priority:

- Citation alerting.
- Team reading lists.
- Zotero integration.
- Slack digest.
- Browser extension.
- API keys.

Later:

- Full literature review agent.
- Figure/table extraction.
- Collaborative annotation.
- Institutional plans.
- Personal knowledge graph.

## Landing Page Angle

The first screen should not be a generic marketing page. It should be a working search/radar interface with upgrade hooks.

Suggested page modules:

- Search bar: "Search or follow a topic..."
- Coverage badge: "644k papers indexed, 644k embedded, 21.2% arXiv coverage."
- Example alert chips:
  - long-context inference
  - LLM agents
  - diffusion policy
  - quantum error correction
  - mechanistic interpretability
- CTA:
  - Free: "Search papers"
  - Paid: "Create research radar"

## Acquisition

SEO:

- Keep every paper/category/author page public.
- Improve titles/meta descriptions.
- Add paper briefs to high-impression pages.
- Keep sitemap and IndexNow current.

Community:

- Show HN: "I built a semantic arXiv radar with 644k embedded papers."
- Reddit posts in r/MachineLearning, r/Physics, r/math, r/LocalLLaMA where allowed.
- Deep links to useful paper/category pages, not just homepage.
- Author outreach: "Your paper page has citation graph + related papers."

Content:

- Weekly "What changed in AI papers this week?"
- Category reports:
  - "Top new cs.LG papers this week"
  - "New long-context papers"
  - "New papers citing Attention Is All You Need"

## Metrics To Watch

Top of funnel:

- Indexed pages.
- Impressions.
- CTR.
- Search visits.
- Paper page exits.
- Return visits.

Activation:

- Searches per visitor.
- Saved papers.
- Follows created.
- Digest signups.
- Semantic alert creation.

Paid:

- Free-to-Pro conversion.
- Digest open rate.
- Alert click-through rate.
- Churn after first month.
- Cost per AI brief.

## Pricing Research Anchors

Comparable research tools already charge for AI/search workflow:

- Consensus has free and paid research-search plans, with Pro around the low double-digit monthly range.
- Elicit has paid tiers for deeper research workflows, reports, exports, API access, and teams.

This supports a starting price around $12-15/month for Pro and $29/month for Power, as long as the product is about recurring workflow rather than raw access.

## Risks

- arXiv branding/commercial compliance.
- Serving or summarizing content in ways that conflict with individual paper licenses.
- AI summaries creating trust problems.
- Too much generic "chat with paper" competition.
- Search traffic is useful but may not convert unless there is a recurring workflow.

## Recommendation

Build a narrow paid beta:

1. Accounts.
2. Saved papers.
3. Follow authors/categories.
4. Semantic alerts.
5. Weekly email digest.
6. Stripe Pro at $12/month or $120/year.

Do not build team features until individual users are saving/following/returning.

## Open Questions

- Which segment converts first: ML engineers, PhD students, or startup teams?
- Should Pro start with email digests only, or include AI briefs immediately?
- How much can be summarized safely from metadata/abstracts alone?
- Should the product brand become less arXiv-like if paid plans become meaningful?
- What is the fastest path to daily active use without harming SEO?
